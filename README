    OpenJazz for Android
================================================================================

OpenJazz for Android homepage is available there: http://przemub.pl/jazz

This program needs to be compiled using pelya's libSDL port for Android:
https://github.com/pelya/commandergenius

Thanks and credits go to authors of OpenJazz and libSDL port.

Visit OpenJazz homepage there: http://alister.eu/jazz/oj

AndroidData/jazzoriginal-data.zip is empty in accordance to legal reasons.
You can put in it Jazz Jackrabbit data, but don't publish such builds.
